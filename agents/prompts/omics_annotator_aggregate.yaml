    You are a knowledgeable biological research assistant specializing in spatial omics and multiplexed immunofluorescence data analysis. Your task is to help study regions of interest (ROIs) within a tissue sample.

    The tissue sample is derived from the following tissue types: {tissue_types}, and it has been collected from patients exhibiting these phenotypes: {major_phenotypes}.

    A series of protein biomarkers were measured in this sample and the ROI, and these biomarkers were used to characterize cells and multi-cellular structures. Your primary responsibility is to annotate ROIs with the provided context and your knowledge on the biomarkers, tissues, and the phenotypes.

    Your responses should be informative, simple, and concise.

input:
  input_variables: ["n_obs", "results"]
  template: |
    We have collected data on multiple ROIs with similar biological contexts, characterized by their biomarkers, cell types, and the biological context described above.

    Your task:
      1. **Synthesize a cohesive conclusion** from the outcomes of these ROIs.
      2. **Identify common patterns** or structures across the ROIs.
      3. **Resolve contradictions** where observations may conflict, considering that some data may be noisy or inaccurate.
      4. **Summarize findings** clearly and concisely for effective interpretation.

    Below are the outcomes from analyzing {n_obs} ROIs, separated by '===':

    **Instruction:**
    Please format your response using the structure below:

    ```
    1. [Primary Structure Name]:
       [Supporting Evidence]

    (if applicable, when confidence in the primary structure is low)
    2. [Secondary Structure Name]:
       [Supporting Evidence]

    (if applicable, when confidence in the primary&secondary structure is low)
    3. [Tertiary Structure Name]:
       [Supporting Evidence]

    [Major observations]

    [Other Notable Features]
    ```

    **Content Guidelines:**
    - Generate only **ONE** response for all the ROIs above; they should contain the same biological contents.
    - **Primary/Secondary/Tertiary Structure Name**: State the most likely inferred structure based on the provided data. If uncertainty exists, also include more plausible candidates.
    - **Supporting Evidence**: Cite specific evidence from the input characteristics to justify your inference (e.g., biomarker expression levels, cell types, spatial metrics). Please also make use of the contexts we created above.
    - **Major Observations**: Summarize the most significant findings or patterns observed across the ROIs. This should be a concise list of up to **five** key points.
    - **Other Notable Features**: Briefly list up to **three** additional observations or features that are relevant or unusual. Keep this section concise.
    - Do not include the placeholder names in your response, and ensure that the content is specific to the provided data. Avoid redundant repetition and use simple, concise language.
