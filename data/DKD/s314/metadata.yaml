major_phenotypes: >
  Kidney-transplant patients with T-cell-mediated rejection or antibody-mediated
  rejection. They exhibited varied HLA mismatches, desensitization, chronic
  antibody-mediated rejection, and diverse renal function and pathology outcomes.

background: |
  Make use of the following background information collected from the Human Protein Atlas:
  ----------------
  CD11b: Selective cytoplasmic expression in subset of immune cells and glial cells. Expressed in monocytes and granulocytes
  CD11c: Cytoplasmic expression in macrophages and cells in lymphoid tissues.
  CD14: Selective expression in subsets of immune cells.
  CXCR3 (CD183): Expressed in proximal tubules, also expressed in distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts
  CD31: Distinct expression in endothelial cells and smooth muscle. Expressed in glomerular endothelial cells, blood vessels and interstitium.
  CD34: Selective cytoplasmic expression in endothelial cells. Expressed in glomerular endothelial cells, blood vessels and interstitium.
  CD3e: Selective cytoplasmic expression in T-cells.
  CD4: Selective cytoplasmic expression in peripheral lymphocytes and subsets of cells in lymphoid tissues.
  CD45: Selective cytoplasmic expression in lymphoid tissue and immune cells.
  CD68: Selective cytoplasmic expression in macrophages.
  CD8: Cytoplasmic expression in subsets of immune cells.
  PGP9.5: Selective expression in CNS, distal renal tubules, islets of Langerhans and spermatogonia in testis. Expressed in distal tubules and collecting duct cells.
  PanCK: Cytoplasmic expression in epithelial cells. Expressed in tubular epithelium.
  Podoplanin: Distinct expression in alveoli, lymphatic vessels, placental and ovarian stroma, myoepithelium and basal cells of squamous epithelia. Expressed in glomerular podocytes
  Vimentin: Distinct cytoplasmic and membranous expression in lymphoid tissues, astrocytes, mesenchymal cells, epidermal Langerhans cells and fractions of glandular cells. Expressed in glomeruli and interstitial space.
  aSMA: Selective expression in smooth muscle cells and myoepithelial cells. Expressed in blood vessels and interstitium.
